PyTrainer

Welcome! This project contains Python scripts and modules to help you train and generate with an AI model.

Project Structure:

train.py (Script to train the AI model)

generate.py (Script to generate output using a trained model)

config.py (Configuration file for customizing training and generation)

utils.py (Utility functions used across the project)

tokenizer/char_tokenizer.py (Tokenizer implementation)

model/transformer.py (Model architecture - Transformer)

data/your_dataset.txt (Dataset for training)

Usage:

Train the Model
Run the training script to start training your AI model:
python train.py
This will use your dataset in data/your_dataset.txt and save a trained model.

Generate Output
After training, use the generated model with:
python generate.py
This script requires the trained model to produce output.

Configuration
The config.py file holds parameters for training and generation. You can edit it to change things like learning rate, batch size, epochs, or generation settings. Only modify this if you understand the impact.

Dependencies:
Make sure you have the required Python packages installed.
